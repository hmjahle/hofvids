## Pipenv
### Installation
* make sure you have python 3 installed so that then you type 
``python --version`` or ``python3 --version`` in your command line, it will show ``python 3.7.*``or something like that.
* If this does not work:
  - make sure python 3 is installed
  - check your environmental variables (Windows) and link to the python.exe file in your python source folder. you can rename it to python3.exe 
  to separate it form python.exe in your python 2 source file
* Then you can use pip3 to install pipenv:
  - ````
    pip3 install pipenv
    ````
  - Make sure you remember/ find out where it is installed (usually /AppData or something)
    - This is because you need the path to the pipenv.exe when opening your source folder in PyCharm
